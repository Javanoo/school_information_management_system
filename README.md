## Summary
![lockscreen](https://github.com/Javanoo/school_information_management_system/blob/main/sims0.png)
On the contrary, this is not a full fledge school management system.<br>
But rather a module of what would be, saying this because as of now the only features or operations-<br>
one could carry out are limited. Needless to say it would be such a good practice for those who want to play with <br>
java and its core features.

## features

1. management of stakeholder information.
2. secure information storage
3. Backup
4. Schedule events (unstable)
5. email stakeholders (unstable)
